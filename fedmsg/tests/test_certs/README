The scripts in this folder are a modification of  EASY-RSA Version 2.0-rc1

This is a small RSA key management package, based on the openssl
command line tool, that can be found in the easy-rsa subdirectory
of the OpenVPN distribution.  While this tool is primary concerned
with key management for the SSL VPN application space, it can also
be used for building web certificates.
